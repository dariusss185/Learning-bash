Bash scripting is useful because it allows users to automate repetitive tasks and perform complex operations on a computer system quickly and efficiently. With bash scripting, users can create scripts that automate tasks such as file manipulation, system configuration, and data processing. These scripts can be run manually or scheduled to run automatically, saving users time and effort.

Bash scripting is particularly useful for system administrators and developers who need to manage large-scale computer systems. It can help them manage servers, automate backups, and perform routine maintenance tasks. Bash scripts can also be used for data analysis and processing, making it a valuable tool for data scientists and researchers.

In addition to its practical applications, learning bash scripting can also be a valuable skill for personal projects and hobbyist programmers. It is a versatile and widely used scripting language that can be used in many different contexts, including web development, automation, and system administration.
